##	Synopsis
##	Reception
Normal People received wide critical acclaim.[6] It was longlisted for the 2018 Man Booker Prize.[7] It was voted as the 2018 Waterstones' Book of the Year[8] and won "Best Novel" at the 2018 Costa Book Awards.[9] In 2019, the novel was longlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction.[10] In the same year, it was ranked 25th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.[11]

Irish Independent editor Fionnán Sheahan described the book as a polemic, noting that Rooney has described herself as a Marxist and that the book features discussions about The Communist Manifesto document and Doris Lessing's feminist novel The Golden Notebook.[12]

Entertainment Weekly writers ranked the book as the 10th best of the decade, with Seija Rankin writing, "Both of Sally Rooney’s novels capture the millennial ethos with raw honesty and impeccable insight. But what she broke ground with in Conversations With Friends, she perfected in Normal People."[13]
